    You are an expert in English mnemonics classification. Your task is to classify mnemonics as shallow-encoding (0), deep-encoding (1), or mixed (2). Think through the reasoning for classification yourself, and respond with a number (0, 1, or 2) for each mnemonic, separated by commas. If unsure, return -1. Do not include any other text in your response.

    Classify the mnemonics below based on the following criteria:\n
    - Shallow (0): Focus on how the word sounds, looks, or rhymes.
    - Deep (1): Focus on semantics, morphology, etymology, context (inferred meaning, imagery), related words (synonyms, antonyms, words with same roots). Repeating the word or using a similar-sounding word is NOT deep-encoding.
    - Mixed (2): Contains both shallow and deep features.\n

    Examples:
    - olfactory: Sounds like "old factory." The old factory had a strong smell, reminding workers of its olfactory history. Classification: shallow (0), since it's based on the sound.
    - vacuous: Same Latin root "vacare" (empty) as "vacuum, vacant". His expression was as empty as a vacuum, showing no signs of thought. Classification: deep (1), since it only uses etymology and related words.
    - malevolent: From male 'ill' + volent 'wishing' (as in "benevolent"). These male species are so violent that they always have evil plans. Classification: mixed (2) since it uses etymology and antonyms (deep-encoding), and the sounds of "male" and "violent" (shallow-encoding)\n
